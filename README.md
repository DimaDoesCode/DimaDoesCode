# Some of my accomplishments

<p><img src="https://github.com/DimaDoesCode/DimaDoesCode/raw/master/face_muzzle.png" width="320" height="160" align="left"/>
I hold a degree in Radiophysics from Lomonosov Moscow State University, and I have authored a paper on the dynamics of superradiation in two-component inhomogeneously broadened media.

My work experience includes roles as a software engineer at a medical institution, an M&C specialist at a telecommunications operator company, and a technical support engineer at a telecom service company. I advanced to the positions of senior engineer and head of the customer support department in the latter role.

In addition, I have served as a marketing manager at a telecommunications equipment manufacturer and as an operations manager/director specializing in customer services for telecom companies. I also worked as a sales marketing manager at an agency company and advised the director general of a multi-purpose service and consulting company.

I collaborated with an American co-author to complete the first edition of a book that highlights the beneficial properties of vitamins that are not commonly known to the general public. The book focuses on early prevention of various diseases and other interesting topics.

And here I am, with a diverse background in both technical and managerial positions in the fields of telecommunications, software engineering, and marketing.<br clear="left"/></p><br>
