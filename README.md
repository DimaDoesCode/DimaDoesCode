# Some of my work and interests

<p><img src="https://github.com/DimaDoesCode/DimaDoesCode/raw/master/face_muzzle.png" width="320" height="160" align="left"/>
I hold a degree in Radiophysics from Lomonosov Moscow State University. My background includes telecommunications, software engineering, and applied data analysis, combining hands-on technical work with experience in operations, support, and engineering management.

Data science and machine learning remain areas of strong personal and professional interest for me, especially in applied and exploratory contexts. Alongside this, I work on system-level and networking projects, including traffic control and automation for embedded and Linux-based systems.

Most of the work presented in this profile consists of independent and pet projects. They are driven by technical curiosity, practical problem-solving, and a desire to better understand systems from both data-driven and low-level engineering perspectives, rather than by direct production needs of large organizations.<br clear="left"/></p><br>

### Featured Project

**[MAC-Shaper](https://github.com/DimaDoesCode/MAC-Shaper)**  
A lightweight traffic shaping solution for **OpenWrt** that provides **per-MAC upload and download bandwidth control** using Linux `tc` and `ifb`.  
Includes a backend daemon, LuCI web interface, and prebuilt packages for embedded devices.  
<i>Fully documented, actively maintained, and production-ready.</i>
